GoalKeeper is an app that is designed to help the user track their goals. The user firsts starts off by logging in through a Google account, after which they are greeted by their name. The home screen in the app allows users to add goals for themselves by setting a name, potential date of completion, and checkpoints for each goal. When each goal is clicked on, a new screen is brought up that is specific to the goal. This new screen lists details about the goals, such as which of the checkpoints are completed and the date that they were completed. This screen also gives users the option to check off checkpoints and list a motivation for themselves for completing this goal. We have also provided a calendar screen that allows users to see when their goals should be completed on a big calendar. Another screen is a progress screen, which provides a visual documentation of the progress of each goal. A progress bar is displayed for the goals on this screen. Finally, our last screen, is a profile screen, on which the user can log out of their Google account and view how many goals they have completed.
